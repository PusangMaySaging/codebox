# CodeBoxSave

Created Using **PHP with MySQL** with **CodeFlask Micro Editor**

## Description

This is my self-project made using **PHP with MySQL**. The project was very simple and inspired by **Hastebin**. I did this project for my fellow students who does not  know how to use **Git and Github**. Whenever, someone is asking help from me, they would send me text file of codes which is somewhat frustrating since i need to download their files and textfile are unformatted. With this web application, I can easily view their code, and paste it into my machine.

## How to Clone

1. Run the following `https://github.com/PusangMaySaging/codebox.git` or download as ZIP.
2. Put the folder in the root local server. If you are using **XAMPP**, Put in **HTDOCS folder**
